                           Prowser Change Log (CHANGES)

0.2.0 (2006-02-21)
------------------
* Implemented "tabbed browsing", rendering the 0.1.0 version of the Prowser API
  incompatible with this new version. As part of this upgrade, a new Tab class
  was added to perform the page request/response transactions previously
  handled by the Prowser class. In the 0.2.0 version, the Prowser class now
  functions to create and own the Tab objects, as well as and maintain global
  state information that is shared across all tabs of a Prowser instance (e.g.,
  cookies, default config values, home page, etc.)
* Overhauled the history mechanism by implementing the following changes:
      o  goBack() and goForward() now return "cached" pages instead of
         automatically refreshing the returned pages. (The returned pages can
         be subsequently refreshed by simply executing tab.refresh().)
      o  Added jumpBack() and jumpForward() methods to simulate the
         functionality provided by the drop-down menus accessed by clicking the
         little arrow buttons on the right sides of Back and Forward buttons in
         mainstream GUI browsers.
      o  Added the getHistoryIndex() method to indicate where the "current"
         page resides in the history.
      o  Added getHistorySize() to indicate how many items are in the history.
* Added public method getTab() to the Response class in order to retrieve
  the Tab object that generated the Response instance.
* Added the following public methods to the Response class:
      o  getUri() - Retrieves the final URI of the loaded page. Note that this
         can be different from the original URI of the request because
         server-side redirects can occur during request processing. Think of
         this value as the URI that appears in a web browser's address bar
         after the page has completed loading.  
      o  getPageTitle() - Obtains a web page's title (i.e., the value in the
         <title> tag).
      o  getContentType() - Retrieve the value of the HTTP Content-type header.
      o  getFilename() - Obtains the name of the retrieved web page file.
* Changed "debug" terminology to "trace". This resulted in the setDebugFile()
  and setDebugLevel() methods being renamed to setTraceFile() and
  setTraceLevel(). Also, the DEBUG_* constants were renamed to TRACE_*. (Note
  that all of these methods and constants are now part of the Tab class instead
  of the Prowser class.)
* Replaced the Request.printRequest() method with an overridden version of
  the toString() method. The output of toString() produces the exact text that
  printRequest() did.

0.1.0 (2006-02-14)
------------------
* Initial release.
